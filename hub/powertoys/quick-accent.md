# Quick Accent utility

Quick Accent is an alternative way to type accented characters, useful for when a keyboard doesn't support that specific accent with a quick key combo. This tool is based on [Damien Leroy's PowerAccent](https://github.com/damienleroy/PowerAccent).

This utility is turned off by default. In order to use the Quick Accent utility, you will need to open PowerToys Settings, select the Quick Accent utility tab, and set the Enable toggle to "On".

## How to activate

Activate by holding the key for the character you want to add an accent to, then press the Activation Key (Space key or Left / Right arrow keys). If you continue to hold, an overlay to select the accented character between multiple characters will appear.

For example: If you want "Ã ", press and hold <kbd>A</kbd> and press <kbd>Space</kbd>.

## How to change the accent

With the dialog enabled, keep pressing your Activation Key. If you have left/right enabled the selection will go in the appropriate direction.

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation key | The customizable keyboard command to toggle the accent when pressing and holding a valid key. |
| Toolbar location | Where on the screen you want the tool. |
