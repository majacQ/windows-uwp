# Publish update for your EXE or MSI app on the Store

We recommend you submit updates for your EXE or MSI apps through the Store. The Store allows existing users to install app updates through the Store, if your installer supports it. The Store does not provide these updates automatically to existing users. 

You can make changes to a published app at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's page in Partner Center and click **Update** on the right-hand side for your app submission that’s live on the Store. This will create a new submission for the application, using the info from your previous submission as a starting point. Make the changes you'd like, and then click **Publish** on Manage Store listings page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Any updates to EXE or MSI apps are subject to [Application Developer Agreement](/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement) and the [Microsoft Store Policies](/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies), which may be updated from time to time. To add new functionalities that require written customer consent via your app update, you must provide notice to customers and get their written consent as required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your app.
