# Analyze app performance for your MSI or EXE apps

You can view detailed analytics for your MSI or EXE apps in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/apps-and-games/overview). Statistics and charts let you know how your apps are performing in the store, from how many customers you've reached to how they're using your app and what they have to say about it. You can also find metrics on app health, app usage, and more.

You can view analytic reports right in Partner Center or download the reports you need, to analyze your data offline. When viewing your analytic reports, you'll see an arrow icon within each chart for which you can download data. Click the arrow to generate a downloadable .tsv file, which you can open in Microsoft Excel or another program that supports tab-separated values (TSV) files.

Each failure name is made up of four parts: one or more problem classes, an exception/bug check code, the name of the image/driver where the failure occurred, and the associated function name.
