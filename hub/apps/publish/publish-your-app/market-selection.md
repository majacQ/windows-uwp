# Define market selection

The Microsoft Store reaches customers in over 200 countries and regions around the world. You can choose the markets in which you'd like to offer your app, with the option to customize many [pricing and availability](price-and-availability.md) features per market or per group of markets.

For info to help make your app suitable for customers around the world, see [Guidelines for globalization](../../design/globalizing/guidelines-and-checklist-for-globalizing-your-app.md) and [Make your app localizable](../../design/globalizing/prepare-your-app-for-localization.md).
