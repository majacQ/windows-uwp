The UI and interaction for Windows Widgets are implemented using [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/). Each widget provides a visual template and, optionally, a data template which are defined using JSON documents that conform to the Adaptive Cards schema. This article walks you through the steps to create a simple widget template. 

## A counting widget

The example in this article is a simple counting widget that displays an integer value and allows the user to increment the value by clicking on a button in the widget's UI. This example template uses data binding to automatically update the UI based on the data context.

Apps need to implement a widget provider to generate and update the widget template and/or data and pass them to the widget host. The article [Implement a widget provider in a win32 app](../../develop/widgets/implement-widget-provider-win32.md) provides step-by-step guidance for implementing the widget provider for the counting widget that we will generate in the steps below.

## The Adaptive Cards Designer

The [Adaptive Cards Designer](https://www.adaptivecards.io/designer/) is an online interactive tool that makes it easy to generate JSON templates for Adaptive Cards. Using the designer, you can see the rendered visuals and the data binding behavior in real-time as you build your widget template. Follow the link to open the designer, which will be used for all of the steps in this walkthrough.

## Create an empty template from a preset

At the top of the page, from the **Select host app** dropdown, choose Widgets Board. This will set the container size for the Adaptive Card to have a size that is supported for widgets. Note that widgets support small, medium, and large sizes. The size of the default template preset is the correct size for a small widget. Don't worry if the content overflows the borders because we will be replacing it with content designed to fit inside the widget. 

There are three text editors at the bottom of the page. The one labeled **Card Payload Editor** contains the JSON definition of your widget's UI. The editor labeled **Sample Data Editor** contains JSON that defines an optional data context for your widget. The data context is bound dynamically to the Adaptive Card when the widget is rendered. For more information about data binding in Adaptive Cards, see [Adaptive Cards Template Language](/adaptive-cards/templating/language).

The third text editor is labeled **Sample Host Data Editor**. Note that this editor may collapse below the page's other two editors. If so, click the + to expand the editor. Widget host apps such as the Widgets Board have two properties that indicate the size and theme of your widget. These properties are named *host.widgetSize* and *host.hostTheme*. The supported sizes are "small", "medium", and "large". The supported themes are "light" and "dark". Your widget template can dynamically display different content based on the current value of these properties. To see how your widget responds to changes in size and theme, you can adjust the values for these properties in the editor, or you can also set these values in the **Container size** and **Theme** dropdowns next to the **Select host app** dropdown at the top of the page. 

## Create a new card

In the upper left corner of the page, click **New card**. In the *Create* dialog, select **Blank Card**. You should now see an empty Adaptive Card. You will also notice that the JSON document in the sample data editor is empty.  

The counting widget that we will create is very simple, only consisting of 4 [TextBlock](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/TextBlock.html) elements and one action of type [Action.Execute](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.Execute.html), that defines the widget's button. 

## Add TextBlock elements

Add four **TextBlock** elements by dragging them from the **Card elements** pane on the left of the page onto the blank adaptive card in the preview pane. At this point, the widget preview should look like the following image. The content again overflows outside of the widget borders, but this will be fixed in the following steps.

:::image type="content" source="images/widgets-designer-walkthrough-1.png" alt-text="An adaptive card in progress. It shows a widget with four lines containing the text New TextBlock. The four lines of text overflow the bottom border of the widget.":::

## Implementing conditional layout

The **Card Payload Editor** has been updated to reflect the **TextBlock** elements that we added. Replace the JSON string for the **body** object with the following:

```json
"body": [
    {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "You have clicked the button ${count} times"
    },
    {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Rendering only if medium",
        "$when": "${$host.widgetSize==\"medium\"}"
    },
    {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Rendering only if small",
        "$when": "${$host.widgetSize==\"small\"}"
    },
    {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Rendering only if large",
        "$when": "${$host.widgetSize==\"large\"}"
    }
]
```

In the Adaptive Cards Template Language, the `$when` property specifies that the containing element is displayed when the associated value evaluates to true. If the value evaluates to false, the containing element is not displayed. In the **body** element in our example, one of the three **TextBlock** elements will be shown, and the other two hidden, depending on the value of the `$host.widgetSize` property.  For more information about the conditionals supported in Adaptive Cards, see [Conditional layout with $when](/adaptive-cards/templating/language#conditional-layout-with-when).

Now the preview should look like the following image:

:::image type="content" source="images/widgets-designer-walkthrough-2.png" alt-text="An adaptive card in progress. It shows a widget with four lines containing the text specified in the JSON payload shown in the previous step. Instead of conditionally hiding elements, all of the elements are visible and overflow the bottom border of the image.":::

Note that the conditional statements aren't being reflected in the preview. This is because the designer isn't simulating the behavior of the widget host. Click the **Preview mode** button at the top of the page to start the simulation. The widget preview now looks like the following image:

:::image type="content" source="images/widgets-designer-walkthrough-3.png" alt-text="An adaptive card in progress. It shows a widget with two lines containing the text specified in the JSON payload. Only the TextBlock for the small size is rendered.":::

From the **Container size** dropdown, select "Medium" and note that the preview switches to only show the **TextBlock** for the medium size. The container in the preview also changes size, demonstrating how you can use the preview to make sure that your UI fits within the widget container for each supported size.

## Bind to the data context

Our example widget will use a custom state property named "count". You can see in the current template that the value for the first **TextBlock** includes the variable reference `$count`. When the widget is running in the Widgets Board, the widget provider is responsible for assembling the data payload and passing it to the widget host. At design time, you can use the **Sample Data Editor** to prototype your data payload and see how different values impact the display of your widget. Replace the empty data payload with the following JSON.

```json
{"count": "2"}
```

Note that the preview now inserts the value specified for the *count* property into the text for the first **TextBlock**.

:::image type="content" source="images/widgets-designer-walkthrough-4.png" alt-text="An adaptive card in progress. The first line of text now includes the value 2 from the data payload.":::

## Add a button

The next step is to add a button to our widget. In the widget host, when the user clicks the button, the host will make a request to the widget provider. For this example, the widget provider will increment the count value and return an updated data payload. Because this operation requires a widget provider, you won't be able to view this behavior in the Adaptive Cards Designer, but you can still use the designer to adjust the layout of your button within your UI.

With Adaptive Cards, interactive elements are defined with **action** elements. Add the following block of JSON directly after the **body** element in the card payload editor. Be sure to add a comma after the closing bracket (]) of the body element or the designer will report a formatting error.

```json
,
"actions": [                                                      
    {                                                               
        "type": "Action.Execute",                               
        "title": "Increment",                                   
        "verb": "inc"                                           
    }                                                               
]
```
In this JSON string, *type* property specifies the type of action that is being represented. Widgets only support the "Action.Execute" action type. The *title* contains the text that is displayed on the button for the action. The *verb* property is an app-defined string that the widget host will send to the widget provider to communicate the intent associated with the action. A widget can have multiple actions, and the widget provider code will check the value of the verb in the request to determine what action to take.

    }
    ],
   "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Action.Execute",
      "title": "Increment",
      "verb": "inc"
    }
  ]
}
