This quickstart walks you through the steps to create, deliver, and display a Windows 10 or Windows 11 toast notification using rich content and interactive actions. This quickstart uses local notifications, which are the simplest notification to implement. All types of apps (WPF, UWP, WinForms, console) can send notifications!
