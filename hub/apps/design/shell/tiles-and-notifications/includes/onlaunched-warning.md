> You must initialize your frame and activate your window just like your **OnLaunched** code. **OnLaunched is NOT called if the user clicks on your toast**, even if your app was closed and is launching for the first time. We often recommend combining **OnLaunched** and **OnActivated** into your own `OnLaunchedOrActivated` method since the same initialization needs to occur in both.
