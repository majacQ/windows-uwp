# Security and identity

This article provides an index of development features that are related to scenarios involving security and identity in Windows apps.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Windows App SDK](../windows-app-sdk/index.md) currently does not provide APIs related to security and identity scenarios.

## Windows OS features

Windows 10 and later OS releases provide a wide variety of APIs related to graphics scenarios for apps. These features are available via a combination of WinRT and Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).

#### WinRT APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via WinRT APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| [Security](/windows/uwp/security) | Learn about the breadth of security features for Windows apps.  |
| [Authentication and user identity](/windows/uwp/security/authentication-and-user-identity) | Windows apps have several options for user authentication, ranging from simple single sign-on (SSO) using Web authentication broker to highly secure two-factor authentication. |
| [Cryptography](/windows/uwp/security/cryptography) | Learn about cryptography features available to Windows apps. |

#### Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the Windows SDK.
