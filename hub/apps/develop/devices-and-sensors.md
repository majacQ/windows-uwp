# Devices and sensors

This article provides an index of development features that are related to scenarios involving devices and sensors in Windows apps.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Windows App SDK](../windows-app-sdk/index.md) currently does not provide APIs related to devices and sensors scenarios.

## Windows OS features

Windows 10 and later OS releases provide a wide variety of APIs related to data and files scenarios for apps. These features are available via a combination of WinRT and Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).

#### WinRT APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via WinRT APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Devices, sensors, and power](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors) | Learn about the breadth of features available for integrating external devices and sensors into your app. |
| [Enumerate devices](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/enumerate-devices) | Learn how to find devices that are internally connected to the system, externally connected, or detectable over wireless or networking protocols. |
| [Sensors](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/sensors) | Learn how to access sensors such as accelerometers, compasses, and gyrometers. |
| [Bluetooth](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/bluetooth) | Learn how to integrate classic Bluetooth (RFCOMM) and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) into your apps. |
| [Printing and scanning](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/printing-and-scanning) | Learn how to print and scan from your app. |
| [3D printing](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/3d-printing) | Learn how to add 3D printing functionality to your app. |
| [Get battery information](/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/get-battery-info) | Learn how to get detailed battery information, including the charge, capacity, and status of a battery or aggregate of batteries. |

#### Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs

The following articles provide information about features available via Win32 (C++ and COM) APIs provided by the Windows SDK.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Sensor API](/windows/win32/sensorsapi/portal) | Learn how to access sensor data using Win32 APIs. |
| [Printing](/windows/win32/printdocs/printdocs-printing) | Learn how to print documents using Win32 APIs. |
| [Power management](/windows/win32/power/power-management-portal) | Learn how to access power management features using Win32 APIs. |

## .NET features

The .NET SDK also provides APIs related to device scenarios for WPF and Windows Forms apps.

| Article | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Printing and print system management (WPF)](/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/printing-and-print-system-management)  | Learn how to print documents using .NET APIs for WPF apps. |
| [Print support (Windows Forms)](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support) | Learn how to print documents using .NET APIs for Windows Forms apps. |
| [Power management in Windows Forms](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/power-management-in-windows-forms) | Learn how to access power management features using .NET APIs for Windows Forms apps. |
