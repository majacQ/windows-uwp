App properties describe important details about your app including requirements, capabilities, and your contact information. The **Properties** page of the [app submission process](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-submission.md) is where you define your app's category and enter other info and declarations. Be sure to provide complete and accurate details about your app on this page.

## Category and Subcategory 
*Category is required*

Categories and subcategories help users discover your app, and they help users understand what your app does.

Choose the category that best describes your app. If that category includes subcategories, select the one that best describes your app. If none of the available subcategories seem to fit, you can leave subcategory blank, or choose a subcategory you think customers who would want your app would be most likely to browse.
