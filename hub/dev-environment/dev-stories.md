# Stories from developers who have switched from Mac to Windows

We thought it may be helpful to hear from other developers about their experiences switching between a Mac and Windows development environment. Most found the process reasonably simple, appreciated that they could still use their favorite Linux and open source tools, while also having integrated access to Windows productivity tools, like [Microsoft Office](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/products-apps-services), [Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook), and [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). Here are a few articles and blog entries that we found:
