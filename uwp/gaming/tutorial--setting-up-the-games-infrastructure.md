# Set up the game project

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is part of the [Create a simple Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game with DirectX](tutorial--create-your-first-uwp-directx-game.md) tutorial series. The topic at that link sets the context for the series.

The first step in developing your game is to create a project in Microsoft Visual Studio. After you've configured a project specifically for game development, you could later re-use it as a kind of template.

## Objectives

* Create a new project in Visual Studio using a project template.
* Understand the game's entry point and initialization by examining the source file for the **App** class.
* Look at the game loop.
* Review the project's **package.appxmanifest** file.

## Create a new project in Visual Studio

> [!NOTE]
> For info about setting up Visual Studio for C++/WinRT development&mdash;including installing and using the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) and the NuGet package (which together provide project template and build support)&mdash;see [Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT](../cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt.md#visual-studio-support-for-cwinrt-xaml-the-vsix-extension-and-the-nuget-package).

First install (or update to) the latest version of the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX); see the note above. Then, in Visual Studio, create a new project based on the **Core App (C++/WinRT)** project template. Target the latest generally-available (that is, not preview) version of the Windows SDK.

## Review the **App** class to understand **IFrameworkViewSource** and **IFrameworkView**

In your Core App project, open the source code file `App.cpp`. In there is the implementation of the **App** class, which represents the app and its lifecycle. In this case, of course, we know that the app is a game. But we'll refer to it as an *app* in order to talk more generally about how a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app initializes.

### The wWinMain function

The **wWinMain** function is the entry point for the app. Here's what **wWinMain** looks like (from `App.cpp`).

```cppwinrt
int __stdcall wWinMain(HINSTANCE, HINSTANCE, PWSTR, int)
{
    CoreApplication::Run(winrt::make<App>());
}
```

We make an instance of the **App** class (this is the one, and only, instance of **App** that's created), and we pass that to the static [**CoreApplication.Run**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.coreapplication.run) method. Note that **CoreApplication.Run** expects an [**IFrameworkViewSource**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource) interface. So the **App** class needs to implement that interface.

The next two sections in this topic describe the [**IFrameworkViewSource**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource) and [**IFrameworkView**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource) interfaces. Those interfaces (as well as **CoreApplication.Run**) represent a way for your app to supply Windows with a *view-provider*. Windows uses that view-provider to connect your app with the Windows shell so that you can handle application lifecycle events.

### The IFrameworkViewSource interface

The **App** class does indeed implement [**IFrameworkViewSource**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource), as you can see in the listing below.

```cppwinrt
struct App : winrt::implements<App, IFrameworkViewSource, IFrameworkView>
{
    ...
    IFrameworkView CreateView()
    {
        return *this;
    }
    ...
}
```

An object that implements **IFrameworkViewSource** is a *view-provider factory* object. That object's job is to manufacture and return a *view-provider* object.

**IFrameworkViewSource** has the single method [**IFrameworkViewSource::CreateView**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource.createview). Windows calls that function on the object that you pass to **CoreApplication.Run**. As you can see above, the **App::CreateView** implementation of that method returns `*this`. In other words, the **App** object returns itself. Since **IFrameworkViewSource::CreateView** has a return value type of [**IFrameworkView**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource), it follows that the **App** class needs to implement *that* interface, too. And you can see that it does in the listing above.

### The IFrameworkView interface

An object that implements [**IFrameworkView**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource) is a *view-provider* object. And we've now supplied Windows with that view-provider. It's that same **App** object that we created in **wWinMain**. So the **App** class serves as both *view-provider factory* and *view-provider*.

Now Windows can call the **App** class's implementations of the methods of **IFrameworkView**. In the implementations of those methods, your app has a chance to perform tasks such as initialization, to begin to load the resources it'll need, to connect up the appropriate event handlers, and to receive the [**CoreWindow**](/uwp/api/windows.ui.core.corewindow) that your app will use to display its output.

Your implementations of the methods of **IFrameworkView** are called in the order shown below.

- [**Initialize**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkview.initialize)
- [**SetWindow**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkview.setwindow)
- [**Load**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkview.load)
- The [**CoreApplicationView::Activated**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.coreapplicationview.activated) event is raised. So if you've (optionally) registered to handle that event, then your **OnActivated** handler is called at this time.
- [**Run**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkview.run)
- [**Uninitialize**](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkview.uninitialize)

And here's the skeleton of the **App** class (in `App.cpp`), showing the signatures of those methods.

```cppwinrt
struct App : winrt::implements<App, IFrameworkViewSource, IFrameworkView>
{
    ...
    void Initialize(Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationView const& applicationView) { ... }
    void SetWindow(Windows::UI::Core::CoreWindow const& window) { ... }
    void Load(winrt::hstring const& entryPoint) { ... }
    void OnActivated(
        Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplicationView const& applicationView,
        Windows::ApplicationModel::Activation::IActivatedEventArgs const& args) { ... }
    void Run() { ... }
    void Uninitialize() { ... }
    ...
}
```

This was just an introduction to **IFrameworkView**. We go into much more detail about these methods, and how to implement them, in [Define the game's UWP app framework](tutorial--building-the-games-uwp-app-framework.md).

### Tidy up the project

The Core App project that you created from the project template contains functionality that we should tidy up at this point. After that, we can use the project to recreate the shooting gallery game (**Simple3DGameDX**). Make the following changes to the **App** class in `App.cpp`.

- Delete its data members.
- Delete **OnPointerPressed**, **OnPointerMoved**, and **AddVisual**
- Delete the code from **SetWindow**.

The project will build and run, but it'll display only a solid color in the client area.

## The game loop

To get an idea of what a game loop looks like, look in the source code for the [Simple3DGameDX](/samples/microsoft/windows-universal-samples/simple3dgamedx/) sample game that you downloaded.

The **App** class has a data member, named *m_main*, of type **GameMain**. And that member is used in **App::Run** like this.

```cppwinrt
void Run()
{
    m_main->Run();
}
```

You can find **GameMain::Run** in `GameMain.cpp`. It's the main loop of the game, and here's a very rough outline of it showing the most important features.

```cppwinrt
void GameMain::Run()
{
    while (!m_windowClosed)
    {
        if (m_visible)
        {
            CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread().Dispatcher().ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessAllIfPresent);
            Update();
            m_renderer->Render();
            m_deviceResources->Present();
        }
        else
        {
            CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread().Dispatcher().ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessOneAndAllPending);
        }
    }
}
```

And here's a brief description of what this main game loop does.

If the window for your game isn't closed, dispatch all events, update the timer, and then render and present the results of the graphics pipeline. There's a lot more to say about those concerns, and we'll do that in the topics [Define the game's UWP app framework](tutorial--building-the-games-uwp-app-framework.md), [Rendering framework I: Intro to rendering](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md), and [Rendering framework II: Game rendering](tutorial-game-rendering.md). But this is the basic code structure of a UWP DirectX game.

## Review and update the package.appxmanifest file

The **Package.appxmanifest** file contains metadata about a UWP project. Those metadata are used for packaging and launching your game, and for submission to the Microsoft Store. The file also contains important info that the player's system uses to provide access to the system resources that the game needs to run.

Launch the **manifest designer** by double-clicking the **Package.appxmanifest** file in **Solution Explorer**.

For more info about the **package.appxmanifest** file and packaging, see [Manifest Designer](/previous-versions/br230259(v=vs.140)). For now, take a look at the **Capabilities** tab, and look at the options provided.

![screenshot with the default capabilities of a direct3d app.](images/simple-dx-game-setup-capabilities.png)

If you don't select the capabilities that your game uses, such as access to the **Internet** for global high score board, then you won't be able to access the corresponding resources nor features. When you create a new game, make sure that you select any capabilities needed by APIs that your game calls.

Now let's look at the rest of the files that come with the **Simple3DGameDX** sample game.

## Review other important libraries and source code files

If you do intend to create a kind of game project template for yourself, so that you can re-use that as a starting-point for future projects, then you'll want to copy `GameMain.h` and `GameMain.cpp` out of the [Simple3DGameDX](/samples/microsoft/windows-universal-samples/simple3dgamedx/) project that you downloaded, and add those to your new Core App project. Study those files, learn what they do, and remove anything that's specific to **Simple3DGameDX**. Also comment out anything that depends on code that you've not yet copied. Just by way of an example, `GameMain.h` depends on `GameRenderer.h`. You'll be able to uncomment as you copy more files out of **Simple3DGameDX**.

Here's a brief survey of some of the files in **Simple3DGameDX** that you'll find useful to include in your template, if you're making one. In any case, these are equally important to understanding how **Simple3DGameDX** itself work.

|Source file|File folder|Description|
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|DeviceResources.h/.cpp|Utilities|Defines the **DeviceResources** class, which controls all DirectX [device resources](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md#resource).

### Next steps

At this point, we've shown how to create a new UWP project for a DirectX game, looked at some of the pieces in it, and started thinking about how to turn that project into a kind of re-usable template for games. We've also looked at some of the important pieces of the **Simple3DGameDX** sample game.

The next section is [Define the game's UWP app framework](tutorial--building-the-games-uwp-app-framework.md). There we'll look more closely at how **Simple3DGameDX** works.
