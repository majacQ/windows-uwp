# Camera barcode scanner system requirements
Starting with Windows 10, version 1803, you can read barcodes through a standard camera lens from a Universal Windows Application.

## Supported Windows Editions

- Windows 10 Professional

## Webcam Requirements
| Category      | Recommendation           | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Focus         | Auto Focus               | Fixed focus is not recommended |
| Resolution    | 1920 x 1440 or later    | We have had best experience with cameras that are capable of 1920 x 1440 resolution or later.  Some lower resolution cameras can read standard barcodes if the barcode is printed large enough. Barcodes with thinner elements may require higher resolution cameras. |
